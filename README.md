# pygame-practice-runner
A [endless runner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endless_runner) platform game created using Python with the pygame library. Base code created using tutorial by [clear-code-projects](https://github.com/clear-code-projects).
This project was built as practice to enhance my Python abilities and gain a fundamental base with the pygame.

Features added by me include:
- Audio Control: toggle game sound by pressing the q key
- Multiple Ways of Controling Character: either press the space key or click on the character to jump
